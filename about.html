            <p><span>I am a foul-mouthed, Joburg-based graphic designer with a love of red meat, the internet, and design. I studied Integrated Graphic Design at the University of Stellenbosch, during which, I completed an internship at Enterprise IG.</span><br><br>Since then I have worked in many facets of design, starting with layout &#38; print design at a niche publishing house.<br><br>Next, on my journey, I became an art director at the BEE advertising agency Vutha. Our clients included Afrox, Netstar, SA Rugby, GSSC and the Department of Arts and Culture. From there I moved to the award-winning direct marketing agency, Action Ambros. There I had the opportunity to work on brands such as Vodacom Business, Telkom, FNB, AIG, and SAICA. From Action Ambros I joined another like-minded designer at her company - the Collective, with clients such as News Cafe, Global Wrapps, Heinz, Original Iced Cocktails and Illy Coffee.<br><br>Once again looking for greener pastures, I became a senior designer at human.kind advertising. I worked on brands including Prominent Paints, Sherwood, Virseker (a 100% Afrikaans insurance brand) and Consol. Being a bit of a social media nerd, my responsibilities soon included updating our corporate Facebook and Twitter pages with the latest news regarding clients, advertising trends and all issues environmental.<br><br>Since then I explored the Social Marketing space at Cerebra as a Senior Designer and the workings of a digital agency at That's It Communications as an Art Director managing a team of designers, animators and illustrators.
